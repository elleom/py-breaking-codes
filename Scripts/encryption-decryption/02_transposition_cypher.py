# Transposition Cypher steps

# Count the number of characters in the message and the key.
# Draw a row of a number of boxes equal to the key (for example, 8 boxes
# for a key of 8).
# Start filling in the boxes from left to right, entering one character
# per box.
# When you run out of boxes but still have more characters, add another
# row of boxes.
# When you reach the last character, shade in the unused boxes in the
# last row.
# Starting from the top left and going down each column, write out the
# characters. When you get to the bottom of a column, move to the next
# column to the right. Skip any shaded boxes. This will be the ciphertext.
